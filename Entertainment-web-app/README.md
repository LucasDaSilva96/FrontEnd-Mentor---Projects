### What I learned

Building this project has been a tremendous learning experience. Here are some of the key takeaways:

1. **Nuxt.js**: I deepened my understanding of Nuxt.js, particularly its server-side rendering capabilities and how to effectively use its file-based routing system. This has significantly improved the performance and SEO of my application.

2. **TypeScript**: Integrating TypeScript into a Nuxt.js project was initially challenging, but it has greatly improved the maintainability and scalability of my codebase. Type safety and autocompletion have made development more efficient.

3. **Directus**: Using Directus as a headless CMS was a new experience for me. I learned how to set up collections, manage content, and fetch data using Directus APIs. This has streamlined the content management process and made it more flexible.

4. **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS has been a game-changer for styling. Its utility-first approach allowed me to rapidly prototype and build responsive designs without writing a lot of custom CSS. I also learned how to customize Tailwind's configuration to fit the needs of my project.

5. **Mobile-first Workflow**: Adopting a mobile-first workflow ensured that the application is fully responsive and provides a great user experience on all devices. This approach has made the design process more efficient and the final product more robust.

6. **API Integration**: I improved my skills in integrating third-party APIs, handling asynchronous data fetching, and managing state in a Nuxt.js application. This has made my application more dynamic and interactive.

These learnings have not only helped me build a better project but also equipped me with skills that I can apply to future projects.
