### Continued development

In this section, I want to highlight areas that I plan to focus on in future projects. These include concepts that I am still mastering and techniques that I found particularly useful and wish to refine further.

1. **Advanced State Management**: While I have a good grasp of state management using Pinia, I want to delve deeper into more advanced patterns and best practices.
2. **Performance Optimization**: I aim to learn more about optimizing the performance of Vue.js applications, especially for larger projects.
3. **Testing**: I plan to improve my skills in writing unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and maintainability of my code.
4. **Accessibility**: Ensuring that my applications are accessible to all users is a priority, and I want to continue learning about best practices in web accessibility.
5. **Responsive Design**: While I have implemented a mobile-first workflow, I want to further refine my skills in creating fully responsive and adaptive designs.
